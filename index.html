      <h2>About Singularity</h2>
      <p>Singularity is a responsive grid system designed to be as flexible and small as possible while still providing an enormous amount of power. Singularity was originally conceived as a way to create asymmetric grids using modular scale but has evolved to support uniform column widths, asymmetric, and compound grids. The tools provided with Singularity make building these unique and complex grids a breeze. Singularity also focuses on different development styles. Your grid can be expressed as classes or it can be written to elements as needed.</p>

      <h2>Basic Singularity Usage</h2>
      
      <p>Singularity: Grids Without Limits. What does that mean? Well, unlike most other grid systems, Singularity supports not only symmetric grid systems where all columns are the same width, but asymmetric grid systems where columns can be of varying widths. This section will teach you how to use the basics of Singularity, from setting up columns to using Singularity's column creating mixin, grid-span. You will learn the basics to get up and running; for the more advanced  stuff, see the <a href="#advanced" title="Advanced Section">Advanced Section</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Setting Up Your Grid</h3>
      
      <h4>Columns</h4>
      
      <p>The first part of setting up any grid system is to set up your columns. While Singularity supports symmetric grid systems, and the first example shows you how, the standard use case for Singularity is asymmetric grids. There are two ways to set up columns, either by writing a single number to create a symmetric grid of that many columns, or by writing a list or using a grid function to create asymmetric grids.</p>
      
      <p><i>Symmetric Grids, 12 Columns Example:</i></p>
      
      <pre><code>$columns: 12;</code></pre>
      
      <p>One thing to keep in mind when creating symmetric grids is that, because Singularity requires a location for each columns as well as its span, common patterns in purely symmetric grid systems such as having defining the span of a class and letting that span float along a row, is not available at this time.</p>
      
      <p><i>Asymmetric Grids, 6 Columns Example:</i></p>
      
      <pre><code>$columns: 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3;</code></pre>
      
      <p>This is an example of an asymmetric grid. In this case, we've created a 6 column grid, with the 2nd column 2 times the width of the 1st, the 3rd column 3 times the width of the 1st, the 4th column being 5 times the width of the 1st, etc…</p>
      
      <p><i>Compound Grids, Compound 3/4 Example:</i></p>
      
      <pre><code>$columns: compound(3, 4);</code></pre>
      
      <p>Compound grids are two or more grids that overlap and create more complex non-uniform grids. Using the function compound() you can list different uniform grids (up to 6) to compound. Note compounding more than two grids may be buggy at the moment.</p>
      
      <p><i>Repeating Grids, 3, 2, 1 Repeat 3 Example:</i></p>
      
      <pre><code>$columns: repeat(3, (3, 2, 1));</code></pre>
      
      <p>If a portion of your grid repeats, you can use the repeat function to easily create patterns. In this example, the asymmetric relation 3, 2, 1 will repeat 3 times, creating a 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1 asymmetric grid.</p>
      
      <p><i>Ratio Grids, Golden Ratio and 4/3 Examples:</i></p>
      
      <pre><code>$columns: ratio(golden-ratio(), 4, 'small')</code></pre>
      <pre><code>$columns: ratio(4/3, 6, 'large')</code></pre>
      
      <p>The ratio function creates an asymmetric grid based on the specified ratio and number of columns you want. Because <a href="https://github.com/scottkellum/sassy-math" target="_blank">Sassy Math</a> is included with Singularity, you can use any math or functions available there, including the golden-ratio() function. The third option in the ratio function is whether you'd like the the columns to start small and get large or start large and get small.</p>
      
      <h4>Gutters</h4>
      
      <p>Gutters, like columns, must be specified in unitless numbers. Gutters are specified in relation to the columns, so if we have a columns definition of 1, 2, 2, 3, the gutter of .25 would make all of the gutters equal to 1/4 the size of the of the first column (1).</p>
      
      <pre><code>$gutter: .25;</code></pre>
      
      <h4>Padding</h4>
      
      <p>You can set uniform padding on all of your columns at once by setting the $padding variable. Padding, like columns, can change depending on location. You can set padding overrides within the $column list. At this time, this only works for setting your columns by hand. Padding may be written in any units.</p>
      
      <p><i>Uniform Padding:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$padding: 1em;</code></pre>
      
      <p><i>Individual Column Padding Override:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$columns: 1, 1 12px, 1;</code></pre>
      
      <p>The above example will set up three equal width columns, with the middle one having 12px padding</p>
      
      <h4>Visualizing your grid</h4>
      
      <p>The quickest way to visualize your grid is with a background gradient. Use this mixin either on the same selector you use the container mixin (see below) on, or on the body depending (depending on your setup) to see your grid!</p>
      
      <pre><code>@include background-grid;</code></pre>
      
      <p>One important thing to keep in mind when using this is that background gradients aren't eh most accurate way to visualize your grid in that it won't show padding and more than likely, due to how they actually get created by the browser, won't line up pixel-perfect to your actual usage. There is a more precise solution in the Visualizing Your Grid section of Advanced Singularity Usage.</p>
      
      <h3>Functions and mixins</h3>
      
      <h4>Base Font Size and Container</h4>
      
      <p>Setting your base font size and your container is an important part of any grid. Setting up your base font size and container is easy, simply set the $base-font-size to what you'd like and your container to the max width you'd like. Containers can be set in any unit you'd like; PX, EM, percentages, etc…</p>
      
      <p><i>Set Base Font Size</i></p>
      <pre><code>$base-font-size: 1em;
@include base-font-sizing;</code></pre>

      <p><i>Set Up Your Container</i></p>
      <pre><code>$container: 100%;
#container {
  @include container;
}</code></pre>
      
      <p>You can use any selector you'd like for the container, this example shows applying the container to an ID of container. The container variable tells the container mixin what you want your max-width to be. The container can be written in any units you'd like, in this case a percentage. If you'd like to automatically convert your container width to EMs based on your Base Font Size, set <code>$container-to-ems: true;</code></p>
      
      <h4>grid mixin</h4>
      
      <p>The bread and butter of any grid system is its grid mixin. Unlike the much more common symmetric grid system, Singularity's grid mixin requires two inputs, <code>$span</code> which tells us how many columns you'd like to span, and <code>$location</code> which tells us what column you'd like to start your span at.</p>
      
      <pre><code>@include grid-span($span, $location);</code></pre>
      
      <p>As an example, let's take the column layout <code>$columns: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4;</code>. If I wanted to span a column to span the first column, I would write <code>@include grid-span(1, 1);</code> for spanning one column starting at the first column. If I wanted to span both 3 columns, I would write <code>@include grid-span(2, 3);</code> because I want to span two columns, and I want to start that span at the 3rd column.</p>
      
      <h4>gutter context</h4>
      
      <p>If you are nesting grids you may want a consistent gutter width. You can easily calculate gutters for the context by writing the gutter width you want followed by its context, like a context of grid-span(3, 3). If you are using symmetric grids, gutter context is, for the most part, automatic.</p>
      
      <pre><code>gutter-context($gutter, $context)</code></pre>

    <section id="advanced">
      <h2>Advanced Singularity Usage</h2>
      
      <p>Singularity has much more power than it lets on through the basic usage. Singularity includes deep integration with the <a href="http://github.com/canarymason/breakpoint" title="Breakpoint Compass Extension">Breakpoint Compass Extension</a> in order to make doing Responsive Web Design with Singularity an absolute breeze. It also has built in support for automatically generating RTL styles, font scaling, and generating classes for a class based grid system as opposed to a purely semantic one. Additionally, the mixins and functions presented above have a slew of optional parameters that you can tap into for added power.</p>
      
      <h3>Language Direction Support</h3>
      
      <p>By default, Singularity outputs its grids assuming a Left to Right (LTR) grid. It also has the ability to output Right to Left (RTL) grids and has the ability to output both LTR and RTL grids. Changing the default is easy.</p>
      
      <p><i>Direction Default Example:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$dir: ltr;</code></pre>
      
      <p>Valid options for direction are ltr, rtl, or both. Both will output both the LTR and RTL grid, so only use it if absolutely necessary as it will write lots of CSS for you. The example shows the default, which you don't need to change if you don't want to.</p>
      
      <p>The default selector for determining whether RTL is selected is to use the dir attribute from the HTML tag, which you can change if you'd like. This applies for both RTL and for the Both direction.</p>
      
      <p><i>RTL Selector Example:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$rtl-selector: '[dir="rtl"]';</code></pre>
      
      <p>This is the best practice for RTL detection in your CSS in general, but can be changed to any selector you'd like. This is also the default, so if you don't change it, this is what you get.</p>
      
      <h3>Responsive Grids</h3>
      
      <p>Singularity supports the ability to specify a list of grids you'd like to use at varying breakpoints as well as having varying padding and gutters for each. This allows for very fine-grain control over your grid system to make your design sing at any screen size.</p>
      
      <p><i>Multiple Grid Setup, 3 Grid Example, Mobile First:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$grids: 3, (3, 5, 7, 5) 500px, ratio(1.75, 7) 900px;</code></pre>
      
      <p>Setting up multiple grids is really quite easy. Write each grid definition, with hand-crafted asymmetric grids wrapped in parenthesis, and include that grid's min or max width (depending of whether or not you're building Mobile First) except for the first grid, which is the "default". In the example above, we're creating 3 grids, the first (default) grid being a 3 column symmetric grid, the second grid being a 3, 5, 7, 5 asymmetric grid that we're going to use at a min-width of 500px, and the third grid being a 7 column grid based on a 1.75 ratio starting at a min-width of 900px. Any column setup you can use for a single gird you can use with multiple grids.</p>
      
      <p><i>Multiple Grid Setup, 3 Grid Example, Desktop First:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$grids: ratio(1.75, 7), (3, 5, 7, 5) 900px, 3 500px;
$grids-mobile-first: false;
</code></pre>
      
      <p>The above example will set up the exact same grid system as the Mobile First example above, but it will build it Desktop First. What this means is that the 7 column grid based on a 1.75 ratio is the default grid, with the 3, 5, 7, 5 asymmetric grid being the second grid and being used until a max-width of 900px, and the 3 column symmetric grid being the second grid and being used until a max-width of 500px.</p>
      
      <p>With either example, it's easy to use grid-span in conjunction with the Breakpoint Compass extension to position along the grid. The next example will show you just how to do it.</p>
      
      <p><i>Using Grids, grid-span, and Breakpoint Example, Mobile First:</i></p>
      <pre><code>#bar {
  @include grid-span(2, 2);

  @include breakpoint(500px) {
    @include grid-span(2, 3);
  }

  @include breakpoint(900px) {
    @include grid-span(4, 1);
  }
}
</code></pre>

      <p>In this example, we're using our Mobile First grid. The grid-span mixin, when used in conjunction with the Breakpoint Compass extension, knows which grid to use. The same holds true for building Desktop First, although we highly suggest you set <code>$breakpoint-default-media: 'max-width';</code> after <code>$grids-mobile-first</code> in your Sass document.</p>
      
      <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
      <p>While the Multiple Grids in Singularity are very smart, they are a compile time solution, not a run time solution. This means that, while using them as in the example above is very easy, the solution relies upon the usage of Breakpoint to function with such ease, as well as relies upon you setting the grid spans at each breakpoint. Singularity will not automatically change you to the new grid at the different breakpoints, so if you are not careful, it's possible you can effectively mix grids.</p>
      
      <h4>Responsive Gutters and Paddings</h4>
      
      <p>With providing multiple grids comes providing multiple gutters and paddings for said grids.</p>
      
      <p><i>Multiple Gutters Example:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$gutters: .25, .3, .4;</code></pre>
      
      <p>In this example, we have provided three gutter definitions. The first gutter will be used for our first grid, the second for our second, and the third for our third; simple. If you provide fewer gutters than there are grids, the last gutter will be used for all remaining grids.</p>
      
      <p><i>Multiple Paddings Example:</i></p>
      <pre><code>$paddings: 0, .5em</code></pre>
      
      <p>In this example, we have provided two padding definitions. The first padding will be used for our first grid and the second padding will be used for both the second and third grids. This is because, like gutters, if you specify fewer paddings than there are grids, the last padding will be used for the remaining grids.</p>
      
      <h3>Additional and Expanded Mixins and Functions</h3>
      <h4>Base Font Size and Container</h4>
      
      <p>Singularity provides an easy way to deal with font scaling and additional options for your container, should you choose to use them.</p>
      
      <p><i>Scaling Base Font Size</i></p>
      <pre><code>$base-font-size: 1em, 2em 500px, 3em 1000px;</code></pre>
      
      <p>If you would like to change your base font size at different breakpoints, it's as easy as following the pattern for laying out multiple grids. Start with your default base font size, comma separate additional font sizes and include their breakpoint. It assumes mobile first, but if you change <code>$grids-mobile-first: false;</code>, it will change to desktop first as well. The above example will set 1em as your default base font size, 2em as the font size at a min-width of 500px, and 3em at a min-width of 1000px. <b>Please keep in mind</b> that if you're using <code>$breakpoint-to-ems: true;</code> to convert your media queries to EMs that those EMs are always based on the browser's root EMs not your base font size, so expect your MQ EMs and any calculated EMs from here to differ.</p>
      
      <p><i>Base Font Size Finder</i></p>
      <pre><code>bfs-finder('min-width');</code></pre>
      
      <p>If you'd like to find your base font size from within a Breakpoint media query, call the bfs-finder function with the query you're looking for (either min-width or max-width) and it will return your current base font size.</p>
      
      <p><i>Expanded Base Font Sizing Mixin</i></p>
      <pre><code>@include base-font-sizing($bfs)</pre></code>
      
      <p>If you'd like to pass in your base font sizes by hand, you can simply pass it in to the base font sizing mixin, although be warned that doing so will make other mixins and functions that rely upon having the base font size variable set not work</p>
      
      <p><i>Multiple Containers</i></p>
      <pre><code>$containers: 100%, 960px 980px. 1024px 1050px;</code></pre>
      
      <p>If you'd like to have multiple container max-widths, it's just like multiple base font sizes. Start with your default add additional max-widths with their breakpoints. This is again controlled by <code>$grids-mobile-first</code> and this example, again, assumes Mobile First. This example starts with a 100% grid, than at a min-width of 980px the max width becomes 960px, and at 1050px the max width becomes 1024px. This works with <code>$container-to-ems</code> and base font size scaling.</p>
      
      <p><i>Expanded Container Mixin</i></p>
      <pre><code>@include container($max-width, $bfs)</code></pre>
      
      <p>If you would like to pass your own variables directly into the Container mixin, you can pass in a single value for $max-width and/or a single value for $bfs (base font size).</p>
      
      <h4>Gird Function</h4>
      
<pre><code>grid-span($span, $location)</code></pre>
      
      <p>The grid function can be used anywhere like borders, padding, margins, or anywhere you might need a grid-based value. It assumes your columns and gutter, <del>and will automatically figure out which columns and gutter to use based on your responsive grids</del>. It can take optional parameters <code>$columns</code> and <code>$gutter</code>.</p>
      
      <h4>Expanded Grid Span Mixin</h4>
      
      <pre><code>@include grid-span($span, $location, $columns, $gutter-span, $padding-span)</pre></code>
      
      <p>These are all of the parameters for the Grid Span mixin. The Grid Span mixin, if not using the defaults, can be used for one-off grids through the <code>$columns</code> parameter, but not responsive grids like you can with the defaults. <code>$gutter-span</code> and <code>$padding-span</code> allow you to pass in custom single value gutter and padding.</p>
      
      <h4>Writing grid objects</h4>
      
      <p>You may prefer using extends or working with classes. You can write every location on the grid using this mixin:</p>
      
<pre><code>@include grid-objects($prefix, $columns, $gutter, $padding, $selector);</code></pre>
      
      <p>By default, this writes placeholder selectors that do not show up in your CSS file. You can always write $selector: "." in the mixin to write classes instead.</p>
      
      <p>The prefix is a name or letter associated with the grid. You can write the mixin within a media query and name the prefix after your breakpoint.</p>
      
      <h4>Visualizing your grid</h4>
      
      <p>Visualizing grids can be one of the more difficult parts of using grid systems. Singularity has two mixins built in to help you with this.</p>

      <p>However, gradients might not be the most accurate. They do not show the padding or use real elements. The test-grid mixin is a standalone mixin that writes styles that are applied to a set chunk of HTML.</p>
      
      <h5>HTML:</h5>
<pre style="font-size: .75em;"><code>&lt;div class="test-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="test a1"&gt;&lt;div class="inner"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
