# Singularity â€¢ ALPHA

### This project is in development and no where near finished, however please feel free to contribute.

## Project Ideals:

* Make tools simple to use.
* Separate theme from framework
* Remain aware of events up the cascade.
* Create a robust set of default styles.
* Never rely on default styles.
* Think big, code small.
* Embrace choice.

## Project Goals:

* Create robust grid functions.
* Combine fixed and responsive design languages.
* Build useful default styles.

## Usage:

* Use the `grid(#)` mixin to say how many columns something spans.
* No `alpha` or `omega` here, the counter is built in. However use the mixin `first-column` if you want to define that.
* Override the counter by writing what column a grid starts on `grid($width, $start-point)`
* No classes are generated by default, all objects remain in the Sass. To generate objects just write `$oocss-grid: true` in your config file.
